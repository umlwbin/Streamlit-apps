prob_good , probably good value. Data value that is probably consistent with real phenomena but this is unconfirmed or data value forming part of a malfunction that is considered too small to affect the overall quality of the data object of which it is a part
prob_bad , probably bad value. Data value recognised as unusual during quality control that forms part of a feature that is probably inconsistent with real phenomena
Interpolated , This value has been derived by interpolation from other values in the data object
Q , Below limit of quantification (LOQ). The value was below the LOQ of the analytical method. The value in the result field is the limit of quantification (limit of detection) for the method
25C , Standardized to 25C
